Automatically update discord if there is a new version when it runs on linux.

Discord, in their wisdom force you to install a new version of discord on Linux whenever one exists but does not handle the update themselves. They also quite regularly update discord. I want to run discord when my computer starts - but this behaviour is making this impossible.

This script installs a new version of discord if it exists and then run discords.

## Installation
You can install discord-autoupdate using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```
pipx install discord-autoupdate
```

## Usage
If you run `discord-autoupdate` this will install a new version of discord if it exists and then run discords.

There are some other options which you can see with `--help`
